## 📖 Overview
**SmartQ** is a queue management application designed to solve the problem of long physical queues in banks, hospitals, and service centers. Instead of standing in line, users can simply scan a generic QR code at the venue to generate a digital token on their device. The system provides real-time updates, allowing users to wait remotely until their turn arrives.

This project was developed as part of my final year BCA curriculum.

## ✨ Key Features
* **QR Code Entry:** Instant access to the queue by scanning a venue-specific QR code.
* **Digital Token Generation:** Automatically assigns a unique token number upon scanning.
* **Real-Time Status:** Users can see the "Current Serving Token" and their "Estimated Wait Time."
* **Admin Dashboard:** Allows staff to call the next number, skip no-shows, and reset queues.
* **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Flutter, or Android XML
* **Backend:** PHP, Node.js, Python Flask/Django
* **Database:** MySQL, Firebase, MongoDB
* **Tools:** VS Code, XAMPP, Android Studio
